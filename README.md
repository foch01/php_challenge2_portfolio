It's the Challenge of my Portfolio

## Step 1

The first step, I made the structure HTML5 and CSS3. I build the model photoshop in version 1.
A first Time, I adapted the site on mobile.

## Step 2

The second step, I made a reconstruction of model on photoshop with more contents.
Then, I build second model photoshop integrate the JavaScript with Librairy FullPage JS and the Framework JQuery.

## Step 3

The third step has not been done. It will be to adapt the site responsive screen with Bootstrap and the Media Queries.

## Step 4

The third step has not been done too. It is to purify the code, delete the class CSS useless, indenting the HTML, delete the function Javascript useless.
